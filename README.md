# Sign_Language_Nhom15
Sign Language Detection

## Overview
This reposity contains implementation of a deep learning model for sign language detection using ViViT ( Video Vision Transformer ) architecture. The model is trained on the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/dotuanminh912/signlanguage-nhom15">Sign Language Detection</a>, hosted on Kaggle.

## Project Structure

- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Tensorflow 2.13+
- Was builded on Kaggle so we just using architecture and packages by Google

### Usage
- Please refer to each block of code, we will not publish the data so you can refer to your own data and train with that custom data.

### Results
The performance of a ViViT model for sign language detection, trained using Kaggle's P100 GPU gave promising descriptive statistics for the model's performance across multiple metrics. We only using top 1-accuray and top 5-accuracy for evaluate this model. The mean top 1 accuracy across 100 epochs reached 84%.
